    Feature-based similarity index, based on phase congruency (PC) and image gradient magnitude (GM)
    There are different ways to implement PC, the authors of the original FSIM paper use the method
    defined by Kovesi (1999). The Python phasepack project fortunately provides an implementation
    of the approach.
    There are also alternatives to implement GM, the FSIM authors suggest to use the Scharr
    operation which is implemented in OpenCV.
    Note that FSIM is defined in the original papers for grayscale as well as for RGB images. Our use cases
    are mostly multi-band images e.g. RGB + NIR. To accommodate for this fact, we compute FSIM for each individual
    band and then take the average.
    Note also that T1 and T2 are constants depending on the dynamic range of PC/GM values. In theory this parameters
    would benefit from fine-tuning based on the used data, we use the values found in the original paper as defaults.
